# 24h Stories App

A React application for creating and viewing 24-hour stories, similar to Instagram Stories. Stories are stored locally using IndexedDB and automatically expire after 24 hours.

## Features

- **Add Stories**: Upload images to create new stories via a simple file input.
- **View Stories**: Click on story thumbnails to open in a full-screen modal.
- **Auto-Advance**: Stories automatically progress every 3 seconds with a smooth progress bar.
- **Navigation**: Use previous/next buttons to manually navigate between stories.
- **Delete Stories**: Remove stories directly from the viewer modal.
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Stories older than 23 hours are automatically deleted to maintain the 24-hour limit.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for a clean, modern UI.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/duckuments/24-stories.git

3. Start the development server:

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal).

## Usage

1. **Adding a Story**:
   - Click the "+" button to upload an image file.
   - The image will be added as a new story thumbnail.

2. **Viewing Stories**:
   - Click on any story thumbnail to open it in the modal viewer.
   - Stories will auto-advance every 3 seconds.
   - Use the left/right arrow buttons to navigate manually.
   - Click the delete button (trash icon) to remove the current story.

3. **Story Management**:
   - Stories are persisted in the browser's IndexedDB.
   - Old stories (older than 23 hours) are automatically cleaned up.
